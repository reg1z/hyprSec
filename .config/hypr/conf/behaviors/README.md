# behaviors

Configs in `~/.config/hypr/conf/behaviors` represent variables defining the way the hyprland environment itself "behaves."

Specifically they're variables which unconditionally apply settings across the entire hyprland environment. No variables associated with any specific layout (dwindle & master) are included.

Despite matching this description, **gap variables** define key visual elements and are instead configured in:
`~/.config/hypr/conf/decorations`

Layouts and their behaviors are defined in:
`~/.config/hypr/conf/layouts`
